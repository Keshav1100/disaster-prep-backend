## Introduction
Earthquakes can strike without warning, making preparedness essential for your safety and that of your loved ones.

## Before an Earthquake
- **Secure Your Home**: Bolt heavy furniture to walls, secure water heaters, and install latches on cabinets
- **Create an Emergency Kit**: Include water (1 gallon per person per day), non-perishable food, first aid supplies, flashlights, and batteries
- **Develop a Family Plan**: Establish meeting points and communication plans

## During an Earthquake
- **Drop**: Get down on hands and knees
- **Cover**: Take cover under a sturdy desk or table, or cover your head and neck with your arms
- **Hold On**: Hold onto your shelter and be prepared to move with it

## After an Earthquake
- **Check for Injuries**: Provide first aid if needed
- **Inspect for Damage**: Look for structural damage, gas leaks, and electrical hazards
- **Stay Informed**: Listen to emergency broadcasts for updates and instructions
- **Be Prepared for Aftershocks**: They can be as dangerous as the main earthquake

## Emergency Kit Essentials
- Water and water purification tablets
- Non-perishable food for at least 3 days
- Battery-powered or hand-crank radio

## Fire Prevention
Fire prevention is the first line of defense against fire-related disasters.

### Home Fire Safety
- **Install Smoke Alarms**: Place them on every level of your home and in every bedroom
